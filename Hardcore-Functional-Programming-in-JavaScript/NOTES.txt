Functions

-Total (For every input there is a corresponding output)
-Deterministic (always receive the same output for a given input)
-No Observable Side-Effects  (No observable effect besides computing a value)

Advantages of pure functions
-Reliable
-Portable
-Reusable
-Testable
-Composable
-Properties/Contract

----------------------
Currying (instead of taking all arguments at one time ; takes one argument at a time and returns a new function expecting the next argument)

Composition (chaining multiple functions together to create a new function)
-Logging in composition (side effecty but helpful for debuging)
const log = curry((tag, x) => (console.log(tag, x), x));
const shout = compose(exclaim, log('tag log'));

Functors (an object with map method, it can be mapped between objects)

Either Monad (functional approach to Error handling,  it has a map, chain, and a fold method)
