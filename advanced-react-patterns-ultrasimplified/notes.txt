Advance React Patterns
-Solve issues related to building reusable components using proven solutions
-Development of highly cohesive components with minimal coupling
-Better ways to share logic between components

----- High-Order Components (Hoc)----------

HOC is a functions that takes the component and returns another component.

----------------------------------

1. Compound Components Pattern 
2. Reusable Styles
3. Control Props
4. Custom Hooks
5. Props Collection 
6. Props Getters
7. State reducers
8. State initializer

UI patterns:
Compound.- The internal components do not work without their main parent. (Share the same state, the same parent state, and the same shared parent state)
They are useful when the user of the component does not need to worry about implementation details.

Render props, extensible styles.
it helps us create user interfaces that are maintainable and easy to extend. A component that is easy to modify.

Logic Patterns: Custom HooKS, HOC, PropsGetters, Props control,
State Initializer ( allows to expose an API to users to be able to reset your component to its original state without having to completely unmount and remount the component).
State reducer (allows to cleanly manage our state's updates based on some criteria)
Reuse logic between components through abstraction.
